# Canonical partial-occupancy first-match atlas (W44-FIX M1 FLAGSHIP)

Maps to **hard input (a)** witness-exhaustive first-match atlas.

Source labels (frontiers draft — grepped before writing):
- thm:canonical-partial-occupancy-atlas L3744  (PO6)
- thm:exact-partial-occupancy L3609  (PO1/PO2)

W44-FIX: |Z_λ°| ≤ |Ω_λ| is STRUCTURAL. Each slope is realized by
`slopeOf` on occupancy cells; Z_λ° is the first-occurrence fold of
slopeOf over ordered Ω_λ cells (dedup), so #distinct-first ≤ #cells
by construction — not by hand-picked constant slope-list sizes.
Deliberate collisions: two cells in Ω_A share slope 0 ⇒ |ZA°|=1 < 2.

Cross-slice first-match (A≺B≺C): a slope claimed earlier is not
re-counted later (filterNotIn on prior claimed slopes).

Occupancy toy (kept):
- D0={0,1,2,3}, X={4}, φ fibers {0,1}/{2,3}, a=2
- Ω_A={(0,1),(2,3)}, Ω_B={(0,2),(0,3),(1,2),(1,3)},
  Ω_C={(0,4),(1,4),(2,4),(3,4)}; ∑|Ω|=10=C(5,2)

slopeOf (deliberate collisions marked *):
  (0,1)↦0, (2,3)↦0*;  (0,2)↦0, (0,3)↦1, (1,2)↦1*, (1,3)↦2;
  (0,4)↦2, (1,4)↦3, (2,4)↦3*, (3,4)↦4

No `sorry`. No mathlib. Dual `native_decide` / `decide`.
