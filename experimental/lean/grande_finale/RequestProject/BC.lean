# The BC program: base-field-normalized split-pencil census (`grande_finale.tex`, `\S`"Proved Prefix and Split-Pencil Reductions")

This file formalizes the *theorem-level*, self-contained parts of the BC program
of the manuscript — the proved reductions that surround the open conjecture BC
(`conj:BC`, "base-field-normalized split-pencil census").  BC itself is a
genuinely open research conjecture: it is an asymptotic `e^{o(n)}` census bound on
the number of primitive split locators in each affine pencil (plus finite
row-wise constants at the deployed rows), and it is *not* a self-contained
theorem.  What is proved here are the surrounding reductions that the manuscript
records as already theorem-level:

* the slope-elimination uniqueness kernel: a non-common support carries at most
  one finite slope (`prop:slope-elimination`);
* the near-rational lattice dichotomy kernels — the parameter-space dimension
  identity `(ω-d₁+1)+(ω-d₂+1) = ω-w+1` and the binomial census count
  `binom(n-d₁, m)` (`thm:near-rational`);
* the MDS decoding-uniqueness kernel behind the near-rational uniqueness
  argument (two degree-`<K` codewords agreeing on `≥ K` points coincide);
* the near-rational-line algebraic identity and the Hamming subadditivity bound
  that place a doubly-near-rational line in the common-proximity paid branch
  (`cor:near-rational-line`);
* the deficiency-one eliminant kernels: the remainder-vanishing split test and
  the eliminant degree bound `j + (n-j+1)·j` (`thm:deficiency-one-eliminant`);
* the split-chart tangent-slope cap `#slopes ≤ |T*|` (`prop:split-chart-tangent`);
* the base-field pigeonhole census count `N·binom(m_{d₁}, m)`
  (`prop:base-field-floor`);
* the extension-valued distinct-slope kernels: the root-count-per-collision bound,
  the distinct-value lower bound, and the pole-averaging selection
  (`prop:rank-one-distinct-slope-floor`, `prop:rank-one-floor`).

Each declaration references the `\label{...}` of the manuscript statement it

/-! ## Slope elimination (`prop:slope-elimination`)

For a support `T` that is not common for both `u` and `v`, the residue vector
`(S_r(v,T))_{r<w}` is nonzero, and the slope equation
`(S_r(u,T))_{r<w} + z(S_r(v,T))_{r<w} = 0` forces `z` from any nonzero coordinate.
Hence there is at most one finite slope. -/

/--
Slope-elimination uniqueness (`prop:slope-elimination`).  If the residue vector
`b` is nonzero, then the affine equation `a r + z·b r = 0` (for all coordinates
`r`) has at most one solution `z`: any nonzero coordinate `b r₀` forces
`z = -a r₀ / b r₀`.

/-! ## Near-rational lattice dichotomy (`thm:near-rational`)

The shifted weak-Popov row degrees satisfy `d₁ + d₂ = n - K + 1` (the determinant
degree).  In the interior branch `d₁ ≥ w+1`, the two multipliers `A, B` have
`deg A ≤ ω - d₁` and `deg B ≤ ω - d₂`, so the parameter space has dimension
`(ω-d₁+1) + (ω-d₂+1) = ω - w + 1`.  In the near-rational branch `d₁ ≤ w`, the
valid supports are exactly the `m`-subsets of the `n - d₁` agreement positions. -/

/--
Near-rational parameter-space dimension (`thm:near-rational`, interior branch).
With the determinant-degree relation `d₁ + d₂ = n - K + 1`, `ω = n - m`, and
`w = m - K`, the total number of multiplier coefficients collapses to
`ω - w + 1` (stated over `ℤ` to avoid truncated subtraction).

Near-rational census count (`thm:near-rational`, near-rational branch).  When the

within distance `w` of `U` would agree on `≥ n - 2w ≥ K` points and hence
coincide.

/-! ## New elements: proper theorems for the former BC cell

The manuscript upgrades the open conjecture BC ("base-field-normalized
split-pencil census") into a family of *proved* statements.  The enumerative
heart is a moving-root incidence bound on one-parameter projective locator
pencils; around it sit the split-pencil dimension bound, the exact saturation
identity that identifies the correct MCA numerator, and the line-ray
bookkeeping.  This section formalizes those new elements. -/

/-! ### The moving-root incidence bound (`thm:bc-moving-root`)

For a projective locator pencil `L_[s:t] = s·A + t·B` over a domain `D` with
fixed `D`-part `G = gcd(A,B,Λ_D)`, each *moving* domain point `x ∈ D ∖ Z(G)`
has `(A(x),B(x)) ≠ (0,0)`, so the homogeneous equation `s·A(x)+t·B(x)=0` has a
unique projective solution `[s:t]`.  Hence a moving point is a root of at most
one pencil member.  If each counted slope `λ` carries at least `h` moving roots,
the incidence count `I` satisfies `h·|Z| ≤ |I| ≤ |D ∖ Z(G)| = n - g`.

The self-contained combinatorial kernel is the following: a family of pairwise
*disjoint* index sets (`inc λ` = the moving roots assigned to slope `λ`), each of
size at least `h` and all contained in the moving-point set `Pts`, forces
`|Z|·h ≤ |Pts|`. -/

/-
Moving-root incidence bound (`thm:bc-moving-root`, counting kernel).  If the sets
`inc λ` (`λ ∈ Z`) are pairwise disjoint, each contained in `Pts`, and each has at
least `h` elements, then `|Z|·h ≤ |Pts|`.  Instantiated with `Pts = D ∖ Z(G)`
(size `n - g`) and `h` moving roots per counted slope, this is the incidence
bound `h·|𝒵| ≤ n - g` of the moving-root theorem.

Off-diagonal stratum bound (`thm:sp-proper`, encoding kernel).  An off-diagonal
shift pair at distance `e` is encoded by a common part `R` of size `m-e`, an
`A`-root set of size `e` inside `D ∖ R`, and a `B`-root set of size `e` inside
`D ∖ (R ∪ A)`.  This encoding is injective, so the number of such pairs is at most
`binom(n, m-e) · binom(n-m+e, e) · binom(n-m, e)`.
