# Lean Certification Map

Status: Tier-1 / stdlib-only arithmetic certificates.

Scope: this map records exactly which Lean theorems certify the finite
submission-gate arithmetic requested in
`experimental/notes/roadmaps/wp_detail/wp1_1_wp1_2_submission_and_lean.md`.
The Lean package deliberately proves only `Nat`, `Int`, and normalized `Rat`
ledger facts.  Reed-Solomon, finite-field, polynomial, and protocol statements
remain cited proofs, verifier outputs, or typed targets.

Current parallel track: `przchojecki` is also working with Aristotle from
Harmonic on a fuller Lean formalization.  That material is not yet included in
this directory; when it lands, it should be added here as a separate
formalization track with its own build instructions, theorem map, and proof
status labels.

Build command:

```bash
cd experimental/lean/rs_mca_formalization
lake build
```

## Audit Rule

For a dossier row to be called Lean-certified by this map, its claim must be
one of the tier-1 arithmetic rows above or a direct conjunction of those rows.
All other dossier claims must be marked `harness-verified`, `cited-proof`, or
`conditional(...)`; this map is not a blanket proof of MCA/list decoding,
finite-field semantics, or protocol soundness.
