# Integer staircase / identity-profile scale (W42 M1)

Maps to **hard input (d)** complete profile-envelope comparison
(the identity staircase scale is the profile numerator budget).

Source label (frontiers draft):
`def:integer-staircase-detail` (L6667):
  At agreement a = K+w, the identity profile has scale
    barN_1 = binom(n,a) · |B|^(-w).
  It is a safe numerator budget only after the full profile envelope
  is e^{o(n)} barN_1 (envelope hypothesis not claimed here).

Explicit toy:
- n=8, K=3, w=2 ⇒ a = K+w = 5
- |B|=2 ⇒ barN_1 = C(8,5) / 2^2 = 56 / 4 = 14
- Exact division: C(8,5) = 14 · 4
- Second step w=1, a=4: barN_1 = C(8,4)/2 = 70/2 = 35
