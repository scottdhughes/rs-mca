# Syndrome-line normal form uniqueness (W43 M1)

Maps to **hard input (a)** first-match atlas / **(c)** ray compiler incidence.

Source labels (frontiers draft — grepped before writing):
- prop:syndrome-line-normal-form L1570
- eq:syndrome-line L1578 (tag 3.2)

Exact conclusion instantiated: for fixed E, at most one finite slope γ with
  s(u0)+γ s(u1) ∈ V_E  and  {s(u0),s(u1)} ⊄ V_E.

Explicit toy (F_5, R=2):
- Syndrome space F_5² with coords mod 5
- V_E = span{(1,0)} = {(a,0) : a ∈ F_5}  (rational-normal column at x=0)
- s0 = (1,1), s1 = (0,1)
- Non-containment: neither s0 nor s1 lies in V_E
- Enumerate γ∈{0,1,2,3,4}: unique bad slope γ=4
  (s0+4·s1 = (1,0) ∈ V_E)

No `sorry`. The enumerated declarations remain stdlib-style; the package now
imports the Mathlib-backed exchange-excess and interior-chart theorems. Dual `native_decide` /
`decide`.
