# F1 Syndrome-Pencil Normal Form

Status: PROVED normal form and branch lemmas / AUDIT verifier / NOT an F1
theorem.

This note extracts a self-contained theorem from the Cycle49
syndrome-transverse-secant audit. It does not prove F1. Its purpose is to
replace the informal "extension-line residue cloud" language by an exact
Hankel-pencil incidence problem with a proved noncontainment test.

The result applies over any field. In the F1 setting one takes
`B subset F`, `D subset B`, and studies `RS[F,D,k]`; genuinely `F`-valued
lines are then handled over the actual line field `F`.

## Set-Up

Let `F` be a field, let

```text
D = {x_1,...,x_n} subset F
```

have distinct points, and let

```text
C = RS[F,D,k],        r = n-k.
```

All statements below assume `0 <= j <= r` and put `t=r-j`. The slope
parameter `z` is always a finite element of `F`, matching the MCA sampler; no
projective point at infinity is included.

For each `x_i`, put

```text
lambda_i = 1 / product_{h != i} (x_i - x_h).
```

For a word `y:D->F`, define its Reed-Solomon syndrome by

```text
Syn(y)_m = sum_i lambda_i x_i^m y(x_i),        0 <= m < r.
```

The standard duality identity says `Syn(y)=0` if and only if `y in C`.

For a complement `T subset D` of size `j`, let

```text
L_T(X) = product_{x in T} (X-x)
       = ell_0 + ell_1 X + ... + ell_j X^j,    ell_j = 1.
```

Let `ell_T=(ell_0,...,ell_j)^T`. Define the Hankel window

```text
H_{t,j}(w)_{m,l} = w_{m+l},        0 <= m < t, 0 <= l <= j
```

for every `w in F^r`.

Finally, let `W_T` be the span of the parity-check columns indexed by `T`:

```text
W_T = span_F { lambda_x (1,x,x^2,...,x^{r-1}) : x in T } subset F^r.
```

Equivalently, `w in W_T` means that `w` is the syndrome of a word supported on
`T`.

## Theorem 1: Hankel Recurrence For A Support Complement

For every `w in F^r`,

```text
w in W_T    if and only if    H_{t,j}(w) ell_T = 0.
```

## Proof

If

```text
w_m = sum_{x in T} c_x x^m,
```

then, for `0 <= m < t`,

```text
(H_{t,j}(w) ell_T)_m
  = sum_{l=0}^j ell_l w_{m+l}
  = sum_{x in T} c_x x^m L_T(x)
  = 0.
```

Thus `W_T` lies in the displayed recurrence space.

Conversely, because `ell_j=1`, the recurrence

```text
sum_{l=0}^j ell_l w_{m+l}=0,        0 <= m < r-j,
```

determines all coordinates `w_j,...,w_{r-1}` from the first `j` coordinates.
Hence its solution space has dimension at most `j`. The columns indexed by the
distinct points of `T` form a Vandermonde system of rank `j`, so
`dim W_T=j`. The two spaces are equal.

## Theorem 2: Exact Line-Incidence And Noncontainment Test

Let `f,g:D->F`, write

```text
u = Syn(f),        v = Syn(g),
```

and let `S=D\T`, so `|S|=n-j=k+t`. For a slope `z in F`, the line point

```text
f + z g
```

is explained by a degree-`<k` codeword on `S` if and only if

```text
(H_{t,j}(u) + z H_{t,j}(v)) ell_T = 0.          (1)
```

Moreover, this explanation is support-wise noncontained for the line `f+zg`
on `S` if and only if, in addition to (1),

```text
H_{t,j}(v) ell_T != 0.                          (2)
```

Consequently the support-wise MCA bad slopes at agreement `k+t` are exactly
the slopes `z` for which there exists a squarefree `D`-split monic locator
`L_T` of degree `j=r-t` satisfying (1) and (2).

## Proof

The word `f+zg` is explained on `S` if and only if there exists a codeword
`c in C` such that `f+zg-c` is supported on `T`. Taking syndromes and using
`Syn(c)=0`, this is equivalent to

```text
u + z v in W_T.
```

Theorem 1 turns this into (1).

The same support `S` simultaneously explains `f` and `g` if and only if

```text
u in W_T        and        v in W_T.
```

Assume (1). If `v in W_T`, then `u=(u+zv)-zv` also lies in `W_T`, so the line
is contained on `S`. Conversely, simultaneous explanation implies `v in W_T`.
By Theorem 1, `v in W_T` is exactly `H_{t,j}(v)ell_T=0`. Thus noncontainment
is precisely (2).

## Corollary 3: Common-Core Dimension Reduction

For fixed line syndromes `u,v`, set

```text
K_0 = ker H_{t,j}(u) cap ker H_{t,j}(v) subset F^{j+1}.
```

Then every active locator vector `ell_T` is tested only through its image in

```text
V = F^{j+1}/K_0,
```

and

```text
dim V <= 2t.
```

Thus the F1 incidence problem at slack `t` is not an incidence problem in the
full `j`-dimensional locator coefficient space. After deleting the common
contained/tangent core, the moving part lives in a space whose dimension is
bounded only by the slack.

## Proof

The equations in Theorem 2 only use `H(u)ell_T` and `H(v)ell_T`, so adding an
element of `K_0` to `ell_T` changes neither the landing condition nor the
noncontainment test.

Also,

```text
codim K_0
  = rank [ H_{t,j}(u) ; H_{t,j}(v) ]
  <= rank H_{t,j}(u) + rank H_{t,j}(v)
  <= 2t,
```

because each Hankel window has `t` rows.

## Corollary 4: Projective Slope Gate

For a complement `T`, put

```text
a_T = H_{t,j}(u) ell_T,        b_T = H_{t,j}(v) ell_T    in F^t.
```

Then `T` contributes a noncontained bad slope if and only if

```text
b_T != 0
```

and `a_T` is a scalar multiple of `b_T`. When this happens, the slope is
unique and is given by

```text
z_T = - a_{T,m} / b_{T,m}
```

for any coordinate `m` with `b_{T,m} != 0`.

Equivalently, `T` passes the slope gate exactly when

```text
a_{T,m} b_{T,l} - a_{T,l} b_{T,m} = 0
        for all 0 <= m < l < t,
```

and `b_T != 0`.

In particular:

- for `t=1`, every complement with `b_T != 0` contributes one slope;
- for `t=2`, the whole landing gate is the single determinant

```text
a_{T,0} b_{T,1} - a_{T,1} b_{T,0} = 0,
```

with the noncontainment condition `b_T != 0`.

## Proof

The landing equation from Theorem 2 is

```text
a_T + z b_T = 0.
```

If `b_T=0`, any landing is contained, by Theorem 2, so `T` contributes no
noncontained slope. If `b_T != 0`, a solution `z` exists exactly when `a_T`
lies on the one-dimensional line spanned by `b_T`; the scalar is forced by any
nonzero coordinate of `b_T`. The displayed minors are the usual rank-one
criterion for the two-column matrix `[a_T b_T]`.

## Corollary 5: Compatibility With Extension Coordinates

Let `B subset F` be a finite field extension, let `D subset B`, and choose a
`B`-basis `omega_1,...,omega_e` of `F`. For `y:D->F`, write

```text
y = sum_i y_i omega_i,        y_i:D->B.
```

Then syndrome formation commutes with coordinate expansion:

```text
Syn_F(y) = sum_i Syn_B(y_i) omega_i.
```

Consequently, if `M_z` is the multiplication-by-`z` matrix in this basis, then
the F1 Hankel-pencil condition over `F`,

```text
(H_F(Syn_F(f)) + z H_F(Syn_F(g))) ell_T = 0,
```

is exactly the coordinate/interleaved base-field condition

```text
H_B(Syn_B(Phi(f)) + M_z Syn_B(Phi(g))) ell_T = 0
```

in the `e` base coordinates.

Thus the syndrome-pencil normal form is the support-level version of the
previous extension-coordinate transfer theorem: extension-line MCA over `F`
is a multiplication-slice incidence problem inside the `e`-interleaved
base-code syndrome space.

## Proof

For `x in D subset B`, both `lambda_x` and `x^m` lie in `B`. Hence

```text
Syn_F(y)_m
  = sum_x lambda_x x^m sum_i y_i(x) omega_i
  = sum_i (sum_x lambda_x x^m y_i(x)) omega_i
  = sum_i Syn_B(y_i)_m omega_i.
```

The line identity follows from `B`-linearity of coordinate expansion and from
the definition of `M_z`.

## Corollary 6: Quotient-Periodic Locator Restriction

Assume now that `D=H` is a multiplicative subgroup of `F^*` of order `n`. Let
`M|n`, write

```text
pi_M(x)=x^M,        H_M=pi_M(H),
```

and let `A subset H_M` have size `j'`. Put `T=pi_M^{-1}(A)`, so
`|T|=j=M j'`. If

```text
L_A(Y) = c_0 + c_1 Y + ... + c_{j'} Y^{j'},
```

then

```text
L_T(X) = L_A(X^M).
```

Equivalently, the locator vector `ell_T` is supported only in degrees
divisible by `M`:

```text
ell_{M s}=c_s,        ell_l=0 if M does not divide l.
```

For every syndrome vector `w`, the Hankel product becomes the decimated
syndrome window

```text
(H_{t,j}(w) ell_T)_m
  = sum_{s=0}^{j'} c_s w_{m+M s},        0 <= m < t.
```

In particular, for `t=2`, a quotient-periodic complement contributes a
noncontained slope exactly when

```text
(B_0,B_1) != (0,0)
```

and

```text
A_0 B_1 - A_1 B_0 = 0,
```

where

```text
A_m = sum_s c_s u_{m+M s},        B_m = sum_s c_s v_{m+M s},
        m=0,1.
```

The slope, when it exists, is `-A_m/B_m` for any nonzero `B_m`.

## Proof

The fiber over `a in H_M` is the set of roots in `H` of `X^M-a`. Hence the
locator of the union of fibers over `A` is

```text
prod_{a in A} (X^M-a) = L_A(X^M).
```

Reading coefficients gives the sparse locator vector. Substituting this sparse
vector into the Hankel product gives the decimated formula. The final `t=2`
criterion is Corollary 4 applied to the two decimated vectors.

## Corollary 7: The Reduced `t=2` Gate Is A Quadric

Assume `t=2`. Let `E=F^{j+1}` be the locator-coefficient space, and define

```text
R:E -> Mat_{2 x 2}(F),        R(ell) = [ a(ell)  b(ell) ],
```

where

```text
a(ell)=H_{2,j}(u)ell,        b(ell)=H_{2,j}(v)ell.
```

Let `W=R(E)`. The bad-slope landing gate is the pullback of the determinant
quadric

```text
det : W subset Mat_{2 x 2}(F) -> F.
```

Equivalently,

```text
q(ell)
  = a_0(ell)b_1(ell) - a_1(ell)b_0(ell).
```

The common-core quotient of Corollary 3 is exactly the passage from `E` to
`W`, and `dim W <= 4`.

If `q` is not identically zero on `W`, then the `t=2` gate is a genuine
quadric hypersurface in the reduced moving image. If `q` is identically zero
on `W`, then `dim W <= 2`; when `dim W=2`, the projective line `P(W)` lies in
one of the two rulings of the rank-one quadric:

- either all matrices in `W` have image contained in one fixed line in `F^2`;
- or all matrices in `W` have kernel containing one fixed line in `F^2`.

Thus the degenerate rank/determinant branch is not an arbitrary high-
dimensional exceptional set. It is a ruled linear artifact. Outside that
artifact, `t=2` F1 becomes an incidence problem between projected split
locators and one explicit quadric in a space of dimension at most four.

For a fixed slope `z`, the fiber is the linear section

```text
a(ell) + z b(ell) = 0.
```

Hence the global `t=2` problem splits into:

```text
determinant incidence:       q(ell)=0,
slope-fiber collision:       ell lies in a two-equation linear section.
```

## Proof

Corollary 4 says exactly that the landing gate is

```text
det [ a(ell) b(ell) ] = 0,
```

and Corollary 3 says the kernel of `R` is the common core
`ker H(u) cap ker H(v)`. Hence the gate descends to `W=R(E)`, whose dimension
is at most four.

It remains only to record the elementary linear-algebra classification of the
identically-zero case. The determinant quadric in `Mat_{2 x 2}` is smooth: in
coordinates

```text
(A_0,A_1,B_0,B_1)
```

its gradient is

```text
(B_1,-B_0,-A_1,A_0),
```

which vanishes only at the zero matrix. Equivalently, the projectivized
determinant-zero cone in `P(Mat_{2 x 2})` is the smooth quadric surface
`P^1 x P^1`, whose maximal projective linear subspaces are its two rulings by
lines. Therefore no three-dimensional linear subspace of `Mat_{2 x 2}` is
contained in the determinant-zero cone, so `dim W<=2`.

If `dim W=2`, choose a rank-one matrix in `W` and change bases in the source
and target so it is

```text
[[1,0],[0,0]].
```

For any other matrix

```text
[[a,b],[c,d]]
```

in `W`, the vanishing of its determinant and of the determinant after adding
the first matrix force

```text
d=0,        bc=0.
```

Thus either `b=0` for the whole second generator, giving a common kernel line,
or `c=0`, giving a common image line. This is exactly the two-ruling
classification.

The fixed-slope statement is just the original landing equation
`a+zb=0`.

## Corollary 8: Fixed-Slope Fibers Are Usually Codimension Two

Assume `t=2` and fix a slope `z in F`. Put

```text
P_z = H_{2,j}(u) + z H_{2,j}(v).
```

Then the support complements contributing the slope `z` are exactly the
squarefree `D`-split monic locators `ell_T` satisfying

```text
P_z ell_T = 0
```

and

```text
H_{2,j}(v)ell_T != 0.
```

Thus same-slope collisions are split-locator intersections with the linear
space `ker P_z`, after deleting the contained part. If `rank P_z=2`, this is
a codimension-two linear section of the locator-coefficient space. If
`rank P_z<=1`, it is a rank-defective exceptional slope.

The rank-defective slope set is tiny unless the whole pencil is degenerate:

```text
#{ z in F : rank P_z <= 1 } <= 2
```

unless `rank P_z<=1` for every `z in F`.

Equivalently, outside at most two slopes, or outside the global rank-one
pencil branch, every same-slope collision problem in the `t=2` F1 reduction is
a split-locator count in a fixed codimension-two linear subspace.

## Proof

The fixed-slope criterion is Theorem 2 with `t=2`, and the noncontainment
condition is unchanged.

For the rank-defective assertion, write the two columns of `P_z` indexed by
`r<s` as affine-linear functions of `z`. The minor

```text
m_{r,s}(z)=det(P_z[:,r], P_z[:,s])
```

is a polynomial of degree at most two. The condition `rank P_z<=1` is exactly
the simultaneous vanishing of all these minors. If at least one minor is not
the zero polynomial, then all rank-defective slopes lie among the roots of
that one nonzero quadratic, hence there are at most two. If every minor is the
zero polynomial, then `rank P_z<=1` identically in `z`.

## Corollary 9: The `j=2` Fixed-Slope Fiber Is Linear-Sized

Assume `t=2` and `j=2`, so support complements have size two. Fix a slope
`z`, and put

```text
P_z = H_{2,2}(u) + z H_{2,2}(v).
```

Let `D` be the evaluation set. Then the number of two-point complements
`T={x,y}` satisfying the landing equation

```text
P_z ell_T = 0
```

obeys the following bounds:

- if `rank P_z=2`, there is at most one such complement;
- if `rank P_z=1`, there are at most `|D|` such complements;
- if `rank P_z=0`, this is a rank-zero exceptional slope and the landing
  equation imposes no restriction.

The same bounds hold after imposing the noncontainment condition
`H(v)ell_T != 0`.

## Proof

For `T={x,y}`, the monic locator vector is

```text
ell_T = (xy, -(x+y), 1).
```

If `rank P_z=2`, the homogeneous kernel of `P_z` is one-dimensional. Its
intersection with the affine monic slice `ell_2=1` is empty or a single point,
so at most one monic locator, and hence at most one complement, can land.

If `rank P_z=1`, the landing equation is one nonzero linear equation

```text
alpha c_0 + beta c_1 + gamma = 0
```

in the locator coefficients. Substituting `c_0=xy` and `c_1=-(x+y)` gives

```text
alpha xy - beta(x+y) + gamma = 0.              (3)
```

If `alpha=0` and `beta!=0`, then (3) fixes the sum `x+y`, giving at most one
partner for each `x` and hence at most `|D|/2` unordered complements. If
`alpha!=0`, then for every `x` except possibly `x=beta/alpha`, equation (3)
determines at most one `y`. At the exceptional `x`, either no `y` works or
the equation factors as

```text
(alpha x - beta)(alpha y - beta)=0,
```

which gives only the star through `x=beta/alpha`. In all cases there are at
most `|D|` unordered distinct complements. The noncontainment condition only
removes complements.

## Corollary 10: The `j=3` Monic-Rank-Two Fiber Is Linear-Sized

Assume `t=2` and `j=3`, so support complements have size three. Fix a slope
`z`, put

```text
P_z = H_{2,3}(u) + z H_{2,3}(v),
```

and let `A_z` be the `2 x 3` matrix formed from the first three columns of
`P_z`, i.e. the columns acting on the non-monic coefficients
`(c_0,c_1,c_2)`.

If `rank A_z=2`, then the number of three-point complements `T` satisfying

```text
P_z ell_T = 0
```

is at most `|D|`. The same bound holds after imposing the noncontainment
condition `H(v)ell_T != 0`.

Moreover, the monic-rank-defective slope set is tiny unless it is global:

```text
#{ z in F : rank A_z <= 1 } <= 2
```

unless `rank A_z<=1` for every `z in F`.

Thus, outside at most two monic-rank-defective slopes, or outside the global
monic-rank-one branch, every `j=3` fixed-slope fiber is linear-sized.

## Proof

Write the monic cubic locator as

```text
L_T(X)=X^3+c_2X^2+c_1X+c_0.
```

If `rank A_z=2`, the affine solution set to `P_z ell=0` in the monic slice is
empty or a line. Therefore every landing locator lies in a one-parameter
family

```text
P_lambda(X)=P_0(X)+lambda Q(X),
```

where `P_0` is monic cubic and `Q` has degree at most two and is not zero.

The common roots of every polynomial in this family are the roots of
`gcd(P_0,Q)`, hence there are at most two of them. A squarefree split cubic
with three roots in `D` therefore has at least one non-common root `x`. For
that root,

```text
P_0(x)+lambda Q(x)=0,        Q(x) != 0,
```

so `lambda` is uniquely determined by `x`. Assign to each landing cubic its
first non-common root in any fixed ordering of `D`; this gives an injection
from landing cubics into `D`. Hence there are at most `|D|` landings.
Noncontainment only deletes landings.

For the final assertion, the condition `rank A_z<=1` is the simultaneous
vanishing of the three `2 x 2` minors of the affine-linear `2 x 3` matrix
`A_z`. Each minor is a polynomial of degree at most two in `z`. If one minor
is not identically zero, there are at most two such slopes. If all minors
vanish identically, the monic-rank-defective branch is global.

## Corollary 11: Global `j=3` Monic-Rank-One Is A Fixed-Root Readout

Assume `t=2` and `j=3`. Suppose the monic-rank defect is global as a
polynomial identity in the slope, i.e.

```text
rank A_z <= 1        for every z
```

where `A_z` is the `2 x 3` matrix from Corollary 10. Then the first four
syndrome entries of the pencil lie on one fixed twisted-cubic line:

```text
(u_0,u_1,u_2,u_3)=a(s^3,s^2t,st^2,t^3),
(v_0,v_1,v_2,v_3)=b(s^3,s^2t,st^2,t^3)
```

for some `[s:t] in P^1(F)` and scalars `a,b in F`.

If `s != 0`, put `alpha=t/s`. For every slope with
`a+zb != 0`, the first row of the landing equation is

```text
(a+zb) s^3 L_T(alpha)=0.
```

Thus every split complement landing at such a slope must contain the fixed
point `alpha`. In particular:

- if `alpha notin D`, there are no such split complements;
- if `alpha in D`, all such split complements lie in the star through
  `alpha`, so there are at most `binom(|D|-1,2)` of them before the second
  row and noncontainment condition are imposed.

If `s=0`, then the first row is zero on the non-monic coefficients and equals
`(a+zb)t^3` on the monic coefficient. Hence every slope with `a+zb != 0` has
no landing split complement at all.

So the global monic-rank-one branch is not a new aperiodic incidence surface:
outside at most one scalar-zero slope, it is either empty or a fixed-root
star.

## Proof

The global hypothesis says that the projective line spanned by
`(u_0,u_1,u_2,u_3)` and `(v_0,v_1,v_2,v_3)` lies in the projective cone of
rank-one `2 x 3` Hankel matrices. This cone is the twisted cubic

```text
[s:t] -> [s^3:s^2t:st^2:t^3],
```

and it contains no projective line. Equivalently, a direct two-point
calculation shows that the sum of two non-proportional points of the above
form violates one of the `2 x 2` Hankel minors. Hence the two pencil vectors
are scalar multiples of one fixed twisted-cubic point.

For `s != 0`, the first row of `P_z` is

```text
(a+zb)s^3(1,alpha,alpha^2,alpha^3),
```

and its dot product with the monic locator vector
`(c_0,c_1,c_2,1)` is `(a+zb)s^3 L_T(alpha)`. This proves the finite-root
claims. The case `s=0` gives first row `(0,0,0,(a+zb)t^3)`, whose dot product
with a monic locator is nonzero whenever `a+zb != 0`.

## Corollary 12: Fixed-Root Stars Contract To `j=2`

Keep the finite-root case of Corollary 11, assume `alpha in D`, and consider
a slope with `a+zb != 0`. Every landing complement has the form

```text
T = {alpha} union U,        |U|=2.
```

Write

```text
L_U(X)=X^2+m_1X+m_0.
```

If the second row of `P_z` is

```text
r=(r_0,r_1,r_2,r_3),
```

then the remaining landing equation is exactly

```text
(r_1-alpha r_0)m_0
  + (r_2-alpha r_1)m_1
  + (r_3-alpha r_2) = 0.                    (4)
```

Thus the fixed-root star is a contracted `j=2` fiber on the punctured domain
`D \ {alpha}`.

Consequently, if the contracted row in (4) is nonzero, the number of landing
complements at this slope is at most `|D|-1`. If the contracted row is zero,
the whole star through `alpha` lands, giving at most `binom(|D|-1,2)`
complements before noncontainment is imposed.

Finally, unless the contracted row is identically zero as a function of the
slope, the zero-contraction slopes number at most one.

## Proof

For `T={alpha} union U`,

```text
L_T(X)=(X-alpha)L_U(X)
```

and therefore the coefficient vector of `L_T` is

```text
(-alpha m_0, m_0-alpha m_1, m_1-alpha, 1).
```

Taking the dot product with `r` gives (4). The finite bound is exactly the
rank-one `j=2` argument from Corollary 9 applied on `D \ {alpha}`. The
contracted row is affine-linear in `z`, so if one component is not the zero
linear polynomial, all simultaneous zeros lie at the root of that component.

## Corollary 13: Global Fixed-Root Stars Have Polynomial Slope Count

Keep the finite fixed-root setting of Corollary 12 with `alpha in D`. Outside
the possible scalar-zero slope `a+zb=0`, the number of noncontained bad slopes
coming from the fixed-root star is at most

```text
binom(|D|-1,2).
```

Including the scalar-zero slope gives the unconditional bound

```text
1 + binom(|D|-1,2).
```

If `alpha notin D`, the corresponding bound is `1`: only the scalar-zero
slope can remain. If the fixed point is infinity, the same bound is `1`.

## Proof

Assume `alpha in D` and `a+zb != 0`. By Corollary 11 every landing complement
has the form

```text
T={alpha} union U,        |U|=2.
```

By Corollary 12 the remaining landing equation is

```text
C_0(z)m_0 + C_1(z)m_1 + C_2(z)=0,              (5)
```

where the coefficients are affine-linear in `z`, and
`L_U(X)=X^2+m_1X+m_0`.

For a fixed pair `U`, either (5) is a nonzero affine-linear equation in `z`,
which contributes at most one slope, or (5) is identically zero in `z`. In the
identically-zero case both the `u`-row and the `v`-row contractions vanish.
Since `L_T(alpha)=0`, both rows of `H(v)ell_T` vanish, so this pair is
contained and is removed by the noncontainment condition. Hence each remaining
pair contributes at most one noncontained slope, giving
`binom(|D|-1,2)`.

If `alpha notin D`, Corollary 11 gives no landing complement away from
`a+zb=0`. If the fixed point is infinity, the first row is nonzero on the
monic coefficient away from `a+zb=0`, so again there are no landing
complements away from the scalar-zero slope.

## Corollary 14: Regular Fixed-Slope Fibers Lose Two Roots

Assume `t=2`, but now allow arbitrary complement size `j >= 2`. Fix a slope
`z`, put

```text
P_z = H_{2,j}(u) + z H_{2,j}(v),
```

and let `A_z` be the `2 x j` matrix formed from the first `j` columns of
`P_z`, acting on the non-monic coefficients `(c_0,...,c_{j-1})` of a monic
degree-`j` locator.

If

```text
rank A_z = 2,
```

then the number of squarefree `D`-split monic degree-`j` locators satisfying

```text
P_z ell_T = 0
```

is at most

```text
binom(|D|, j-2).
```

The same bound holds after imposing noncontainment
`H_{2,j}(v)ell_T != 0`.

Moreover, as `z` varies, the slopes with `rank A_z <= 1` number at most two
unless `rank A_z <= 1` identically in `z`. Hence outside at most two
monic-rank-defective slopes, or outside the global defective branch, every
fixed-slope fiber has the displayed codimension-two split-locator size.

## Proof

If the affine monic system is inconsistent, there is nothing to prove.
Otherwise its solution set is an affine family

```text
P_0(X) + V,
```

where `P_0` is monic of degree `j`, `V` is a vector space of polynomials of
degree `< j`, and

```text
dim V = j-2.
```

Let `L_T` be any landing locator in this family, with `T subset D` and
`|T|=j`. The evaluation map

```text
ev_T: V -> F^T
```

is injective: if `Q in V` vanishes on every point of `T`, then `Q` has at
least `j` distinct roots but degree `< j`, so `Q=0`. Thus some subset
`R subset T` of size `j-2` already makes

```text
ev_R: V -> F^R
```

an isomorphism. Choose the first such `R` in any fixed ordering of the
`(j-2)`-subsets of `T`.

For a fixed `R`, the equations

```text
P(x)=0,        x in R,
```

determine the element `P in P_0+V` uniquely, because `ev_R` is invertible on
`V`. Therefore the above choice injects landing locators into the
`(j-2)`-subsets of `D`, giving the claimed bound.

The noncontainment condition only deletes landing locators. The defective
slope assertion is the same minor argument as in Corollary 10: the `2 x 2`
minors of the affine-linear matrix `A_z` are quadratic polynomials in `z`; if
one is not identically zero, the simultaneous zero set is contained in its at
most two roots.

## Corollary 15: Global Monic-Rank-One Is Always A Fixed-Root Star

Assume `t=2` and `j >= 2`. Suppose the monic-rank defect is global as a
polynomial identity in the slope:

```text
rank A_z <= 1        for every z,
```

where `A_z` is the `2 x j` matrix from Corollary 14. Then the first `j+1`
syndrome entries of the pencil lie on one fixed rational-normal point:

```text
(u_0,...,u_j)=a(s^j,s^{j-1}t,...,st^{j-1},t^j),
(v_0,...,v_j)=b(s^j,s^{j-1}t,...,st^{j-1},t^j)
```

for some `[s:t] in P^1(F)` and scalars `a,b in F`.

If `s != 0`, put `alpha=t/s`. For every slope with `a+zb != 0`, the first
row of the landing equation is

```text
(a+zb)s^j L_T(alpha)=0.
```

Thus every split complement landing at such a slope must contain the fixed
point `alpha`. Consequently:

- if `alpha notin D`, there are no non-scalar-zero landing complements;
- if `alpha in D`, all such landing complements lie in the star
  `T={alpha} union U`, with `|U|=j-1`.

In the case `alpha in D`, the number of noncontained non-scalar-zero slopes
coming from this whole global branch is at most

```text
binom(|D|-1,j-1),
```

and including the possible scalar-zero slope gives

```text
1 + binom(|D|-1,j-1).
```

If `alpha notin D`, or if `s=0`, the corresponding total bound is `1`.

At any fixed non-scalar-zero slope in the fixed-root case, a nonzero
contracted row leaves at most `binom(|D|-1,j-2)` landing complements, while a
zero contracted row leaves the whole fixed-root star before noncontainment is
imposed.

## Proof

The global hypothesis says that the projective line spanned by
`(u_0,...,u_j)` and `(v_0,...,v_j)` lies in the projective variety cut out by
the `2 x 2` minors of

```text
[ w_0  w_1  ...  w_{j-1} ]
[ w_1  w_2  ...  w_j     ].
```

This variety is the degree-`j` rational normal curve

```text
[s:t] -> [s^j:s^{j-1}t:...:st^{j-1}:t^j].
```

Indeed, if `w_0 != 0`, the adjacent minors force a single ratio
`w_{m+1}/w_m`; if the first nonzero coordinate occurred strictly between
`w_0` and `w_j`, the minor using the previous column would force its square
to vanish. Hence the only remaining endpoint case is `[0:...:0:1]`. Since a
rational normal curve contains no projective line for `j >= 2`, the two
pencil vectors are scalar multiples of one fixed rational-normal point.

For `s != 0`, the first row of `P_z` is

```text
(a+zb)s^j(1,alpha,...,alpha^j),
```

and its dot product with the monic locator vector is
`(a+zb)s^j L_T(alpha)`. This proves the fixed-root or empty landing
alternative away from the scalar-zero slope. If `s=0`, the first row has only
the monic coordinate nonzero, so no monic locator can land away from the
scalar-zero slope.

It remains to count noncontained slopes in the fixed-root case
`alpha in D`. Write

```text
T={alpha} union U,        L_T(X)=(X-alpha)L_U(X),
```

where `L_U(X)=m_0+m_1X+...+m_{j-1}X^{j-1}` is monic. If
`r=(r_0,...,r_j)` is the second row of `P_z`, then

```text
r . ell_T = sum_{h=0}^{j-1} (r_{h+1}-alpha r_h)m_h.       (6)
```

For a fixed `U`, the right side is affine-linear in `z`. If it is not the
zero affine-linear function, it contributes at most one slope. If it is
identically zero, then the corresponding contractions for both `u` and `v`
vanish. Since `L_T(alpha)=0`, the first row of `H(v)ell_T` also vanishes, and
(6) gives the second row. Thus `H(v)ell_T=0`, so this landing is contained
and is removed by noncontainment.

Therefore each choice of `U subset D \ {alpha}` with `|U|=j-1` contributes at
most one noncontained non-scalar-zero slope. There are
`binom(|D|-1,j-1)` such choices.

For the fixed-slope landing bound, a nonzero contracted row is one affine
linear equation on monic degree-`j-1` locators over `D \ {alpha}`. The same
evaluation-injection argument as in Corollary 14, with dimension `j-2`, gives
`binom(|D|-1,j-2)`. If the contracted row is zero, every `U` in the punctured
domain lands before noncontainment is checked.

## Corollary 16: The `t=2` Branch Ledger

Assume `t=2` and `j >= 2`. For each slope put

```text
P_z = H_{2,j}(u) + zH_{2,j}(v),
```

and let `A_z` be the `2 x j` non-monic block of `P_z`. Let `Bad` be the set
of noncontained bad slopes. Then exactly one of the following alternatives
holds.

1. **Global monic-rank defect.** If `rank A_z <= 1` for every `z`, then
   Corollary 15 applies. The branch is empty, an infinity branch, or a
   fixed-root star. In particular, if the fixed root is `alpha in D`, then

   ```text
   |Bad| <= 1 + binom(|D|-1,j-1),
   ```

   while if the fixed point is infinity or `alpha notin D`, then `|Bad| <= 1`.

2. **Non-global monic-rank defect.** Otherwise the defective slope set

   ```text
   Z_def = { z in F : rank A_z <= 1 }
   ```

   has size at most two. Every bad slope outside `Z_def` lies in the regular
   branch `rank A_z=2`, and at each such fixed slope the number of landing
   complements is at most

   ```text
   binom(|D|,j-2).
   ```

   Thus all bad slopes outside the two exceptional defective slopes come from
   the non-global determinant incidence problem: squarefree `D`-split monic
   locators whose projective gate of Corollary 4 is noncontained and whose
   induced slope has `rank A_z=2`.

If in addition `D=H` is a multiplicative subgroup and the complement is
quotient-periodic, the quotient part of this ledger is exactly the sparse
pullback/decimated determinant branch of Corollary 6. Hence, after quotient
cores are budgeted separately, the remaining `t=2` F1 obstruction is the
aperiodic non-global determinant incidence branch in the reduced space of
Corollary 7.

## Proof

If `rank A_z <= 1` identically, Corollary 15 gives the fixed rational-normal
readout and the displayed slope counts.

Otherwise at least one `2 x 2` minor of `A_z` is a nonzero quadratic
polynomial in `z`. All slopes with `rank A_z <= 1` are roots of this one
quadratic, so `|Z_def| <= 2`. For `z notin Z_def`, Corollary 14 applies and
gives the fixed-slope landing bound `binom(|D|,j-2)`. Corollary 4 identifies
the remaining regular bad slopes as the image of the noncontained determinant
gate on split locators. Corollary 6 supplies the quotient-periodic
specialization when `D` is a subgroup.

## Corollary 17: The Zero Reduced Quadric Has No New Branch

Keep the assumptions `t=2` and `j >= 2`, and let

```text
W = R(F^{j+1}) subset Mat_{2 x 2}(F)
```

be the reduced moving image from Corollary 7. Suppose the determinant
vanishes identically on `W`.

Then the zero-quadric branch contributes no new aperiodic F1 obstruction:

- if `dim W <= 1`, all noncontained bad locators in this reduced branch have
  the same slope, so the branch contributes at most one bad slope;
- if `dim W=2` and `P(W)` lies in the common-kernel ruling, then again all
  noncontained bad locators have one fixed slope;
- if `dim W=2` and `P(W)` lies in the common-image ruling, then the whole
  pencil has global monic-rank defect and Corollary 15 applies.

Consequently the unresolved non-global determinant incidence branch in
Corollary 16 may be taken to have determinant not identically zero on the
reduced image `W`.

## Proof

If `dim W <= 1`, then every nonzero matrix in `W` is a scalar multiple of one
rank-one matrix. If its second column is zero there is no noncontained bad
slope; otherwise the column ratio, and hence the slope `z` with `a+zb=0`, is
fixed.

Now assume `dim W=2`. By Corollary 7, `P(W)` lies in one of the two rulings
of the determinant quadric.

In the common-kernel ruling there is a fixed nonzero vector `(lambda,mu)` such
that

```text
lambda a(ell) + mu b(ell) = 0
```

for every reduced locator image `[a(ell) b(ell)]`. If `lambda=0`, then
`b(ell)=0` for every image and noncontainment removes the branch. If
`lambda != 0`, every noncontained bad locator has the single slope
`z=mu/lambda`.

In the common-image ruling, all matrices in `W` have image in one fixed line
of `F^2`. Thus the two rows of both Hankel windows are proportional with the
same ratio:

```text
H_{2,j}(u)_{1,*}=c H_{2,j}(u)_{0,*},
H_{2,j}(v)_{1,*}=c H_{2,j}(v)_{0,*}
```

for some `c in F`, with the endpoint case meaning that the zeroth rows
vanish. Hence the non-monic block `A_z` has rank at most one for every `z`,
so the global monic-rank defect case of Corollary 15 applies.

## Corollary 18: Line Packets In The Reduced Quadric

Keep `t=2`, and let `Q` be the determinant quadric in the reduced image
`W subset Mat_{2 x 2}(F)`. Let `L=P(U)` be a projective line in `P(W)`,
where `U subset W` is a two-dimensional linear subspace. Then:

- if `Q` does not contain `L`, the packet contributes at most two reduced
  image points, hence at most two bad slopes;
- if `L subset Q` and `L` is in the common-kernel ruling, the packet
  contributes at most one bad slope;
- if `L subset Q` and `L` is in the common-image ruling, the determinant
  equation alone gives no slope bound: the slope map on `L` is a projective
  coordinate map and can be nonconstant.

Thus any many-slope line packet inside the remaining nonzero reduced quadric
must lie on a common-image ruling line. All other line packets are already
bounded by the determinant degree or by a fixed kernel slope.

## Proof

If `Q` does not contain `L`, then `Q cap L` is the zero set of a nonzero
homogeneous quadratic on `P^1`, so it has at most two points over `F`. Each
noncontained reduced image point determines at most one slope by Corollary 4.

If `L subset Q`, then by the ruling classification used in Corollary 7 the
line has either a common kernel or a common image. In the common-kernel case
there is a fixed nonzero `(lambda,mu)` such that

```text
lambda a + mu b = 0
```

for every image `[a b]` in the line. If `lambda=0`, then `b=0` and
noncontainment removes the packet. Otherwise every noncontained point has the
single slope `z=mu/lambda`.

In the common-image case, after choosing a basis of the fixed image line,
points of `L` are represented by pairs of scalars `[A:B]`:

```text
[a b] = [A e  B e].
```

The noncontained slope is `z=-A/B` when `B != 0`, which is a nonconstant
projective coordinate on the line unless the packet has collapsed to one
point. Therefore this ruling family is the only line packet not controlled by
the preceding alternatives.

## Corollary 19: Common-Image Packets Reduce To Row-Cut Resonance

Keep the common-image line-packet case of Corollary 18. Let
`eta=(eta_0,eta_1) != 0` be a row functional killing the fixed image line in
`F^2`. Define the two scalar rows

```text
h_u = eta_0 H_{2,j}(u)_{0,*} + eta_1 H_{2,j}(u)_{1,*},
h_v = eta_0 H_{2,j}(v)_{0,*} + eta_1 H_{2,j}(v)_{1,*}.
```

Every split locator whose reduced image lies in this common-image packet
satisfies

```text
h_u ell_T = 0,        h_v ell_T = 0.          (7)
```

If the two equations (7) have rank two on the monic locator slice, then the
packet contains at most

```text
binom(|D|,j-2)
```

split locators, and hence contributes at most that many slopes.

Consequently the only common-image line packets not already bounded by the
degree-two line sieve are the **row-cut resonant** packets where the killed
rows `h_u,h_v` have rank at most one on the monic locator slice.

## Proof

If `R(ell_T)` lies in the common-image line, both columns
`a(ell_T)` and `b(ell_T)` lie in the fixed image line. Applying `eta` gives
(7).

On the monic locator slice, rank two of (7) means the solution set is empty or
an affine family

```text
P_0(X)+V
```

with `dim V <= j-2` and `deg V < j`. The evaluation-injection argument from
Corollary 14 applies verbatim: choose, for each split locator in the family,
the first `(j-2)`-subset of its roots on which evaluation is injective for
`V`. A fixed subset determines the polynomial uniquely, so the split locators
inject into the `(j-2)`-subsets of `D`. This gives the displayed bound. Each
locator has at most one noncontained slope by Corollary 4.

If the rank is at most one, the line-packet sieve has reached a genuine
one-row recurrence resonance rather than a quadric-line issue; this is the
remaining subcase.

## Corollary 20: Rank-One Row Cuts Lose One Root

Keep the row-cut resonant case of Corollary 19. If the killed-row equations
have rank zero on the monic locator slice, then the common-image condition is
global and the zero reduced quadric branch of Corollary 17 applies.

Otherwise the nonempty resonant packet is contained in one affine hyperplane

```text
h ell_T = 0
```

on monic degree-`j` locators. The number of squarefree `D`-split locators in
this packet is at most

```text
binom(|D|,j-1),
```

and hence the packet contributes at most that many bad slopes.

This one-root-loss order is unavoidable for a bare row cut: the equation
`L_T(alpha)=0` with `alpha in D` leaves exactly the fixed-root star through
`alpha`, of size `binom(|D|-1,j-1)`.

## Proof

Rank zero means both killed-row affine equations vanish on the full monic
slice. Equivalently the killed row functional annihilates the two Hankel
windows on the whole coefficient space, so the reduced image has the same
common-image direction globally. This is the zero reduced quadric branch
already handled by Corollary 17.

In rank one, the common-image packet is cut out, on the monic slice, by one
nonzero affine linear equation. If the equation is inconsistent there is
nothing to prove. Otherwise its solution set is an affine family

```text
P_0(X)+V
```

with `dim V <= j-1` and every `Q in V` of degree `< j`. For each squarefree
split `L_T` in the family, evaluation `V -> F^T` is injective because a
nonzero polynomial of degree `<j` cannot vanish on all `j` distinct roots of
`T`. Hence some `(j-1)`-subset `R subset T` already gives an injective
evaluation map on `V`. Choosing the first such `R` injects the landing
locators into the `(j-1)`-subsets of `D`, because a fixed `R` determines the
unique element of `P_0+V` vanishing on `R`. This gives
`binom(|D|,j-1)`.

Finally, Corollary 4 gives at most one noncontained slope per locator.

## Corollary 21: Full Stars Force Evaluation Row Cuts

Let `alpha in D`, assume `|D \ {alpha}| >= j`, and let

```text
h ell_T = 0
```

be a row-cut hyperplane on monic degree-`j` locators. Suppose this hyperplane
contains the whole fixed-root star through `alpha`:

```text
h ell_{{alpha} union U}=0
        for every U subset D \ {alpha}, |U|=j-1.
```

Then `h` is a scalar multiple of the evaluation row

```text
(1, alpha, alpha^2, ..., alpha^j).
```

Consequently the row-cut hyperplane is exactly

```text
L_T(alpha)=0.
```

For squarefree `D`-split locators this is precisely the fixed-root star
`alpha in T`. Thus a row-cut packet containing a full star is not a new
common-image obstruction; it belongs to the fixed-root branch already
isolated in Corollaries 15 and 16.

## Proof

Write `T={alpha} union U` and `L_T=(X-alpha)L_U`, where `L_U` is monic of
degree `j-1` and split over `D \ {alpha}`. Define a linear functional on
degree-`<=j-1` coefficient vectors by

```text
psi(Q)=h((X-alpha)Q).
```

By hypothesis, `psi(L_U)=0` for every split monic `L_U` with roots in
`D \ {alpha}`.

Since `|D \ {alpha}| >= j`, choose `S subset D \ {alpha}` of size `j`. The
`j` monic degree-`j-1` polynomials

```text
L_{S \ {s}}(X),        s in S,
```

are affinely independent in the monic slice: evaluating at the points of `S`
gives a diagonal matrix with nonzero diagonal entries. Hence their affine
span is the full monic degree-`j-1` slice. Because `psi` vanishes on all of
them, it vanishes on the full monic slice, and therefore on every
degree-`<=j-1` coefficient vector.

Thus `h` annihilates the image of multiplication by `X-alpha`. The cokernel of
that multiplication map is one-dimensional and is generated by evaluation at
`alpha`; equivalently, a degree-`j` linear functional vanishing on all
multiples of `X-alpha` is a scalar multiple of
`P -> P(alpha)`. In coefficient coordinates this row is
`(1,alpha,...,alpha^j)`.

For a squarefree `D`-split locator, `L_T(alpha)=0` holds exactly when
`alpha in T`.

## Corollary 22: Root-Slice Recursion For Row Cuts

Let

```text
h=(h_0,...,h_j)
```

be a nonzero row cut on monic degree-`j` locators, and fix `beta in D`.
Define its contraction at `beta` by

```text
C_beta(h)=(h_1-beta h_0, h_2-beta h_1, ..., h_j-beta h_{j-1}).
```

Then the row-cut condition on locators containing `beta` is exactly the
lower-degree row cut

```text
C_beta(h) ell_U = 0
```

on monic degree-`j-1` locators `L_U`, where

```text
T={beta} union U,        L_T(X)=(X-beta)L_U(X).
```

Assume now that `|D \ {beta}| >= j` for every `beta in D` and that the
row-cut packet contains no full fixed-root star. Then the number `N_h` of
squarefree `D`-split monic degree-`j` locators satisfying `h ell_T=0` obeys

```text
N_h <= (|D|/j) binom(|D|-1,j-2)
     = ((j-1)/j) binom(|D|,j-1).
```

Thus, once full fixed-root stars have been moved to the fixed-root ledger by
Corollary 21, every remaining rank-one row-cut packet gains a uniform
`(j-1)/j` factor over the bare one-root-loss bound.

## Proof

For `T={beta} union U`, write

```text
L_U(X)=m_0+m_1X+...+m_{j-1}X^{j-1}.
```

The coefficient vector of

```text
L_T(X)=(X-beta)L_U(X)
```

is

```text
(-beta m_0, m_0-beta m_1, ..., m_{j-2}-beta m_{j-1}, m_{j-1}).
```

Taking the dot product with `h` gives

```text
h ell_T = sum_{a=0}^{j-1} (h_{a+1}-beta h_a)m_a
        = C_beta(h) ell_U.
```

This proves the recursion.

If the packet contains no full fixed-root star, then by Corollary 21 no
contracted row `C_beta(h)` is zero. Therefore, for each fixed `beta`, the
number of landing locators containing `beta` is at most

```text
binom(|D|-1,j-2)
```

by Corollary 20 applied on `D \ {beta}` with degree `j-1`. Counting incidences
`(beta,T)` with `beta in T` gives

```text
j N_h <= |D| binom(|D|-1,j-2),
```

which is the displayed bound.

## Why This Helps F1

This section is a proof program, not a completed positive F1 theorem.  It
identifies the branch ledger that remains after the proved normal-form
reductions below.

The naive extension-field lift is already false: genuinely `F`-valued lines
can create slopes that no `B`-valued theorem sees. The theorem here gives the
replacement target:

```text
count z in F for which a Hankel pencil
H(u)+zH(v)
has a squarefree D-split locator in its kernel,
with H(v)ell != 0.
```

For `D subset B` and `F/B` an extension, this is a basis-free statement over
the actual line field `F`. Combined with the coordinate-transfer note, it is
also the base-field multiplication-slice problem in the `e`-interleaved code.
Corollary 5 makes this compatibility exact at the syndrome-pencil level.

The remaining positive F1 theorem should therefore be an inverse-incidence
bound in the reduced space `V`: after quotient-periodic locator families and
contained/tangent cores are separated, the number of slopes whose moving
kernel meets the projected `D`-split locator variety should be polynomial in
`n` above the corrected reserve. Corollary 4 is the finite gate for that
program: first count split locators satisfying the determinant equations, then
control collisions of the resulting rational slope map `T -> z_T`.
Corollary 6 makes the quotient-periodic part explicit: it is the sparse
pullback subspace `L_A(X^M)`, and the `t=2` gate is the corresponding
decimated-syndrome quadratic. Corollary 7 separates the remaining
rank/determinant branch into a ruled linear degeneracy and a genuine quadric
incidence problem. Corollary 8 then controls the slope-collision side: except
for at most two rank-defective slopes, or the global rank-one pencil branch,
same-slope fibers are codimension-two split-locator intersections. Corollary 9
closes the first nontrivial complement size: for `j=2`, every fixed-slope
fiber is either unique, linear-sized, or one of the explicitly marked
rank-zero exceptional slopes. Corollary 10 handles the next complement size:
for `j=3`, the monic-rank-two branch is already linear-sized, so only the
monic-rank-defective slopes remain as the first genuinely new incidence
branch. Corollary 11 then identifies the global monic-rank-one branch as a
fixed-root star or empty branch, leaving only the scalar-zero slope and the
non-global exceptional slopes as special cases. Corollary 12 reduces that
fixed-root star to a contracted `j=2` fiber, with at most one additional
zero-contraction slope unless the contraction vanishes globally. Corollary 13
uses noncontainment to bound the whole fixed-root star branch by
`1+binom(|D|-1,2)` slopes, so it is polynomial and no longer part of the
aperiodic obstruction. Corollary 14 then removes the special role of `j=3`
from the regular fixed-slope analysis: for every complement size, a
monic-rank-two slope loses two roots, leaving only the two exceptional
monic-rank-defective slopes or the global defective branch as the genuine
same-slope obstruction. Corollary 15 then identifies that global defective
branch in every degree as a fixed-root star, with an explicit noncontained
slope count, so the remaining F1 obstruction is pushed back to the non-global
quadric/rank-defective incidence rather than an uncontrolled all-depth
same-slope family. Corollary 16 records this as a branch ledger: scalar-zero
slopes, non-global monic-rank-defective slopes, global fixed-root stars, and
quotient-periodic pullbacks are now explicit ledger entries. The unresolved
positive F1 estimate is therefore concentrated in one named place, the
aperiodic non-global determinant incidence branch in the reduced `t=2`
quadric. Corollary 17 removes the identically-zero reduced quadric from that
remaining branch: the open case is the nonzero determinant quadric incidence
after quotient-periodic and contained components have been removed. Corollary
18 further isolates the only line packet inside that branch that can carry
many slopes: common-image ruling lines. Non-ruling lines and common-kernel
ruling lines are already bounded. Corollary 19 then reduces common-image
packets to a row-cut rank test: rank-two row cuts are bounded by
`binom(|D|,j-2)`, leaving only rank-one row-cut resonance as the line-level
subcase still needing a packing argument. Corollary 20 bounds that bare
rank-one row cut by `binom(|D|,j-1)` and shows the fixed-root star has the
same one-root-loss order; improving further requires extra structure, such as
quotient-periodic removal or an aperiodic packing input. Corollary 21 shows
that the full-star extremizer itself is not a new obstruction: a row cut
containing a whole fixed-root star must be the evaluation cut `L_T(alpha)=0`,
which is already in the fixed-root ledger. Corollary 22 then gives a
root-slice recursion and a star-free count, so row-cut packets without a full
star are smaller than the bare one-root-loss packet by a fixed `(j-1)/j`
factor.

## Verification

The companion verifier

```text
experimental/scripts/verify_f1_syndrome_pencil_normal_form.py
```

checks Theorem 2 and Corollary 3 by exhaustive enumeration over small
quadratic-extension cases. It compares the Hankel-pencil criterion against
direct interpolation on every support complement and every extension-field
slope, checks the projective gate, checks coordinate-syndrome compatibility,
and checks the quotient-periodic pullback formulas where the parameters admit
nontrivial quotient fibers. It also runs fast algebraic checks for the
`t=2` reduced quadric, including a full-rank nonzero determinant form and a
crafted ruling-degenerate zero determinant form. The quadric checks also
enumerate fixed slopes and verify the rank-defective dichotomy of
Corollary 8. In the `j=2` exhaustive cases, the verifier also checks the
fixed-slope fiber bounds of Corollary 9, and it includes constructed
rank-two, rank-one fixed-sum, rank-one star, and rank-zero `j=2` fibers so all
branches of the bound are exercised. It also includes constructed `j=3`
fixed-slope fibers for the monic-rank-two line, monic-rank-one plane,
monic-rank-defective rank-two, and rank-zero branches, plus global
monic-rank-one finite-root, outside-domain, and infinity checks for
Corollary 11. The finite-root check also verifies the contracted `j=2` star
bound of Corollary 12 and the noncontained slope-count bound of Corollary 13.
Finally, constructed `j=4` and `j=5` fixed-root fibers verify the arbitrary
`j` codimension-two bound of Corollary 14. Additional `j=4` global
monic-rank-one cases verify the fixed-root, contained-star, outside-domain,
and infinity branches of Corollary 15. Corollary 16 is the formal branch
ledger obtained by combining those audited pieces. The reduced-quadric audit
also checks the common-kernel ruling used in Corollary 17. Separate reduced
line-section checks exercise the two-point, common-kernel, and common-image
cases in Corollary 18. The constructed `j=4` and `j=5` rank-two fixed-root
fibers also audit the rank-two row-cut bound used in Corollary 19. A
constructed `j=4` fixed-root row cut audits the one-root-loss bound in
Corollary 20 and the full-star inverse statement of Corollary 21. A
non-star `j=4` row cut audits the root-slice count of Corollary 22.
