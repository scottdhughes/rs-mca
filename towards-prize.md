# Towards the Proximity Prize: v9 Execution Plan

Status: working plan / source-of-truth roadmap

Date: 2026-06-30

This document is the current execution plan for turning the RS-MCA repository
into a serious Proximity Prize submission package.  It replaces the older
strict264/frontier-search roadmap.  The center of gravity is now Paper D v9:
the aperiodic Hankel chart atlas and the corresponding proof-packet schema.

The goal is not to collect more impressive-looking lower bounds.  The goal is
to determine thresholds.  For a row \(C\), that means proving adjacent
safe/unsafe agreement levels for the exact MCA/list object used by the prize.

## 1. The Prize-Shaped Object

For
\[
        C=\operatorname{RS}[\mathbb F,D,k],
        \qquad n=|D|,\qquad \rho=k/n,
\]
the Proximity Prize regime uses
\[
        \rho\in\{1/2,1/4,1/8,1/16\},
        \qquad k\le 2^{40},
        \qquad |\mathbb F|<2^{256},
        \qquad \varepsilon^*=2^{-128}.
\]

For support-wise MCA, write
\[
        B_C(a)
        =
        \#\{\text{bad line parameters with agreement at least }a\},
\]
with the denominator \(q_{\rm line}\) explicitly stated.  Define
\[
        B_*(q_{\rm line})=\left\lfloor q_{\rm line}/2^{128}\right\rfloor .
\]

A row is threshold-pinned at adjacent agreement levels \(a_0,a_0+1\) if
\[
        B_C(a_0)>B_*(q_{\rm line})
        \quad\text{and}\quad
        B_C(a_0+1)\le B_*(q_{\rm line}).
\]
Everything else is secondary.  A lower bound without the adjacent safe-side
upper bound is useful evidence, but it is not a prize-shaped solution.

Endpoint conventions must be printed every time:

```text
agreement at least a
closed integer radius r = n-a
closed real radius via floor(delta n)
finite affine slope denominator |F|
projective slope denominator |P^1(F)| = |F|+1
challenge/protocol denominator q_chal, if different
```

## 2. Current State

### 2.1 Settled

The no-slack smooth-domain MCA/RCA optimism is dead.  Paper A gives explicit
obstructions.  Positive statements must include reserve and explicit quotient
floors.

Paper D v9 is the current Paper D package.  It preserves the v8 universal cap,
first-grid cap, quotient-support ledger, and quotient-image ledger, and adds
the aperiodic Hankel chart atlas.

For the finite row
\[
        C=\operatorname{RS}[\mathbb F_{17^{32}},H,256],
        \qquad |H|=512,
\]
the pure finite-slope support-wise MCA threshold is pinned in the
high-agreement tangent range:
\[
        LD_{\rm sw}(C,506)=7,
        \qquad
        LD_{\rm sw}(C,507)=6,
\]
and
\[
        6\cdot2^{128}<17^{32}<7\cdot2^{128}.
\]
So the closed integer-grid transition is:

```text
safe:        radius <= 5, agreement >= 507
first unsafe radius: 6, agreement 506
real closed safe interval: [0, 6/512)
supremum: 6/512 = 3/256, not attained
```

This is a good partial result.  It is not the full prize.

### 2.2 Not Settled

The full prize still needs safe-side upper bounds in the lower-agreement,
near-capacity region where tangent exactness is not enough and quotient floors
are large.

The central unresolved object is:
\[
        B_C(a)
        \le
        B_{\rm tan}(a)
        +
        B_{\rm quot}(a)
        +
        B_{\rm ap}(a)
        +
        B_{\rm ext}(a),
\]
with each term explicitly defined, deduplicated, and divided by the correct
field denominator.

The new v9 atlas is designed to attack \(B_{\rm ap}(a)\), the aperiodic
Hankel/residue-line term after tangent and quotient branches have been removed.

## 3. Strategic Decision

The best path now is:

1. keep the finite \(F_{17^{32}}\) threshold as the clean partial-submission
   result;
2. stop treating strict264/strict352 as the main frontier;
3. use strict264/strict352 only as mechanism tests and quotient-floor examples;
4. make Hankel proof packets the standard format for every new safe-side claim;
5. prove or refute the aperiodic local limit through the v9 chart atlas.

In practice, every useful PR should now answer one of these questions:

```text
Does it produce a v9 Hankel proof packet?
Does it reduce a residual v9 chart to quotient/tangent/extension structure?
Does it prove a reusable theorem needed by such packets?
Does it audit the exact prize object, denominator, or endpoint convention?
```

If the answer is no, it is probably not on the shortest path.

## 4. The v9 Hankel Proof Packet

Paper D v9 gives the contributor-facing atlas.  For a row and exact agreement
\[
        A,\qquad j=n-A,\qquad t=A-k,
\]
a proof packet must do the following.

### 4.1 Remove Paid Ledgers

Before calling anything aperiodic, remove the branches already paid by:

```text
tangent/common-code-line ledger
quotient-support ledger
quotient-image ledger
known subfield/confinement ledger
known projective or curve endpoint ledger
```

These removals must be referenced in the JSON packet.  The schema field is
`removed_ledgers`.

### 4.2 Regular Overdetermined Bucket

If
\[
        t\ge j+1
        \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
        2A\ge n+k+1,
\]
form
\[
        M_A(Z)=H_{t,j}(u)+Z H_{t,j}(v).
\]

A nonzero \((j+1)\times(j+1)\) minor
\[
        \Delta_A(Z)
\]
is a root-containment certificate:
\[
        \text{bad finite slopes at exact agreement }A
        \subseteq
        \{\Delta_A=0\},
\]
so the contribution is at most
\[
        \deg \Delta_A \le j+1=n-A+1.
\]

This is the first thing to try.  It is cheap and should become scripted.

### 4.3 Affine Pivot Charts

If the regular bucket is singular or too weak, build locator charts \(X\) and
split by finite affine pivots
\[
        B_h(\ell)\ne0.
\]

On such a chart the slope is
\[
        Z=-A_h(\ell)/B_h(\ell),
\]
and the chart ideal is generated by the collinearity equations
\[
        A_mB_h-A_hB_m=0
\]
plus the graph equation
\[
        ZB_h+A_h=0,
\]
saturated by the chart denominator \(\Delta_X B_h\).

A nonzero eliminant
\[
        Q_{X,h}(Z)
        \in
        \widehat J^{\rm aff}_{X,h}\cap F[Z]
\]
bounds the chart contribution by \(\deg Q_{X,h}\).

### 4.4 Projective Infinity

For projective slopes \([Z_0:Z_1]\), the finite patch is the affine atlas.
The extra point is
\[
        [0:1],
\]
controlled by the chart
\[
        B=0,\qquad A\ne0.
\]

Each projective packet must certify the infinity chart as empty or nonempty.
If nonempty, it contributes at most one projective parameter.

### 4.5 Curve Pivots

For a finite-parameter degree-\(d\) power curve
\[
        W_\Gamma=f_0+\Gamma f_1+\cdots+\Gamma^d f_d,
\]
split by coefficient pivots
\[
        (V_i)_h\ne0.
\]

A nonzero eliminant
\[
        Q_{X,i,h}(\Gamma)
\]
in the saturated curve incidence ideal bounds the bad curve parameters in that
chart by \(\deg Q_{X,i,h}\).

### 4.6 Allowed End States

Every exact-agreement bucket and every chart must end as exactly one of:

```text
eliminant
empty
dimension_degree
residual_obstruction
```

Residual obstructions must be labelled as:

```text
quotient
tangent
extension
candidate_new_obstruction
unknown
```

Do not hide a singular bucket under "aperiodic evidence."  If the chart is not
closed, name the obstruction.

### 4.7 Machine Format

Use:

```text
scripts/aperiodic_eliminant_schema.json
```

Required packet fields:

```text
schema_version = "aperiodic-hankel-eliminant-v1"
row: n, k, field, domain_hash
agreement_threshold
sampler
removed_ledgers
exact_agreements
regular_minor records
chart records
pivot records
root_union_table_ref
declared_aperiodic_numerator
```

The schema is not a proof by itself.  It is the index of the proof packet.  The
packet must also include equation files, eliminant files, root tables, and
verification transcripts.

## 5. Immediate Milestones

These are ordered.  Do not jump to later milestones before the earlier ones
exist in a reviewable form.

### M0. Definition Freeze

Produce a short definition note that fixes the exact object for the prize-facing
MCA row:

```text
support-wise MCA predicate
same-support noncontainment
finite affine slope sampler versus projective sampler
endpoint convention
q_gen, q_line, q_chal
closed-grid versus supremum threshold
```

Exit criterion:

```text
one file under experimental/notes/audits/
one table saying which repo theorem uses which convention
no "officially solved" language
```

### M1. v9 Schema Verifier

Write a checker for `scripts/aperiodic_eliminant_schema.json`.

It should verify:

```text
JSON schema validity
j = n-A
t = A-k
removed ledgers are referenced
residual labels are present when required
degree/root counts are arithmetically consistent
declared numerator matches the root-union table
```

This checker does not need to verify Groebner/ideal membership at first.  It
should make bad packets impossible to pass off as complete.

Exit criterion:

```text
scripts/check_aperiodic_eliminant_packet.py
one passing toy packet
one intentionally failing packet
documented expected output
```

### M2. Smoke-Test v9 on a Settled Row

Create a proof packet for the already-settled high-agreement row
\[
        C=\operatorname{RS}[\mathbb F_{17^{32}},H,256],
        \qquad A=506,507.
\]

This is not mathematically new.  It tests the packet format on a row whose
answer is known:

```text
A=506: numerator 7, unsafe
A=507: numerator 6, safe
```

Exit criterion:

```text
experimental/data/certificates/hankel-smoke-f17-506-507/
JSON packet conforming to v1 schema
root/numerator table
auditor note explaining why this is a format test, not a new theorem
```

### M3. Regular Non-Tangent Window

For the \(F_{17^{32}}\), \(n=512,k=256\) row, the regular overdetermined minor
condition starts at
\[
        A\ge385,
\]
while the tangent exact theorem starts at
\[
        A\ge427.
\]

The window
\[
        385\le A\le426
\]
is the first useful v9 stress test: regular Hankel minors may give upper bounds
where tangent exactness does not.

Exit criterion:

```text
for each A in a selected subrange:
  nonzero minor or singular declaration
  degree bound
  root-count table
  comparison against tangent/quotient ledgers
```

If the minors vanish or give weak bounds, that is useful.  It identifies the
first real singular bucket.

### M4. Quotient and Tangent Subtraction

Integrate the v9 packets with the existing quotient-image and tangent ledgers.
For each exact agreement \(A\), output:

```text
B_tan(A)
B_quot_support(A)
B_quot_image(A)
B_ap_regular(A)
B_ap_pivot(A)
B_ext(A)
deduped total upper bound
known lower bound
gap to B_*(q_line)
```

Exit criterion:

```text
one table for the F_17^32 row
one table for a Prime192 scanner row
no double-counting between removed ledgers and aperiodic roots
```

### M5. Singular Bucket Program

For every singular bucket produced by M3/M4, build pivot charts.

Attack order:

1. affine pivots \(B_h\ne0\);
2. projective infinity \(B=0,A\ne0\);
3. curve coefficient pivots \((V_i)_h\ne0\);
4. dimension-degree fallback only as a diagnostic;
5. residual classification.

Exit criterion:

```text
each singular chart is eliminant / empty / dimension_degree / residual_obstruction
every residual has label quotient/tangent/extension/candidate_new_obstruction/unknown
candidate_new_obstruction has a minimal reproducible example
```

### M6. M1 Theorem Candidate

Once enough rows/charts are understood, state the theorem we actually want:

\[
        B_{\rm ap}(a)\le n^B
\]
after quotient, tangent, and extension-confined branches are removed.

There are two acceptable forms:

```text
finite-row theorem:
  proves a specific row's threshold

uniform theorem:
  proves an explicit n^B bound for all rows satisfying printed hypotheses
```

The finite-row theorem is enough for a partial result.  The uniform theorem is
the route to the full prize.

## 6. Parallel Mathematical Lanes

The v9 Hankel lane is central, but it cannot finish the whole prize alone.
These lanes feed into or consume the Hankel packets.

### L1. Generated-Field Locator Local Limit

Needed for list decoding and for converting arbitrary received-word locator
fibers into usable ledgers.

Target:
\[
        \#\{\text{aperiodic locator fibers}\}\le n^B
\]
above the corrected reserve, with quotient-periodic fibers explicitly budgeted.

First deliverables:

```text
monomial-prefix proof packets
quotient-removed toy enumerations
arbitrary-word Hankel/catalecticant reductions
bad-prime or finite-collision classification
```

Do not use \(q_{\rm line}\) to pay a \(q_{\rm gen}\) entropy bill.

### M1. Aperiodic Residue-Line Packing

This is the main MCA theorem lane.  It should now be written in v9 language:

```text
tangent and quotient branches removed
regular minors tested
affine/projective/curve pivot charts built
singular residual buckets classified
deduped root count compared to B_*(q_line)
```

The first useful theorem is not "MCA is small."  It is:

```text
Every non-small v9 residual bucket is quotient, tangent, extension-confined,
or a named new obstruction.
```

### F1. Extension-Line Lift or Counterexample

Needed because extension-valued lines may not be explained by base-field
witnesses.

Target:

```text
Either prove base/generated-field MCA bounds lift to F-valued lines,
or produce a genuinely F-valued obstruction with its own ledger.
```

Every F1 result must say:

```text
B, F
q_gen, q_line, q_chal
whether the line is B-valued, F-valued, or subfield-confined
whether the bad slopes live in a proper subfield
```

### L2. Interleaved-List Constants

Needed for the list side of the prize and for protocol ledgers.

Use the codegree reduction, but do not oversell it.  It reduces interleaved
lists to base-list fibers at agreements \(a\) and \(2a-k\); it does not prove
the base L1 input.

Target:

```text
base aperiodic list bound at a
higher-agreement decay at 2a-k
quotient tails kept explicit
interleaved numerator divided by the correct challenge field
```

### M2. Line-Decoding Formulation

Needed to state the corrected MCA theorem in the language many protocols use.

Target:

```text
exact equivalence or one-way implication between support-wise MCA bad slopes
and line-decoding ambiguity, with agreement/radius endpoints explicit
```

M2 should consume the M1/Hankel packets and output line-decoding threshold
statements without changing denominators.

### X1. List-CA-MCA Bridges

Needed only when a proof crosses objects.  Every bridge must state the loss:

```text
radius loss
field-size loss
square-root or no-square-root loss
support-wise versus ordinary support convention
finite/projective/curve sampler
```

No bridge may be used silently.

## 7. Full-Prize Assembly Theorem

The final theorem should not be vague.  It should have this form.

Input:

```text
field tower B <= F
smooth domain D
n, k, rho
q_gen, q_line, q_chal
sampler type
target epsilon = 2^-128
quotient profile
certificate packets for relevant exact agreements
```

Output:

```text
safe agreement a_safe
unsafe agreement a_unsafe = a_safe - 1
delta convention
B_tan, B_quot, B_ap, B_ext, B_list ledgers
proof status for each ledger
final comparison against B_*(q_line) or protocol denominator
```

The final comparison should look like:

\[
        B_{\rm total}(a_{\rm safe})
        \le
        \left\lfloor q_{\rm line}/2^{128}\right\rfloor
\]
and
\[
        B_{\rm lower}(a_{\rm unsafe})
        >
        \left\lfloor q_{\rm line}/2^{128}\right\rfloor.
\]

For protocol/list statements replace \(q_{\rm line}\) by the exact denominator
used by that statement and print the replacement.

## 8. What To Work On Next

The next useful PRs, in order:

1. **Schema checker.**
   Validate v9 proof packets before any new math is claimed.

2. **Hankel smoke packet for \(F_{17^{32}}\), \(A=506,507\).**
   Exercise the format on a settled row.

3. **Regular-minor extractor.**
   Given row data and exact agreement \(A\), compute candidate nonzero minors
   and root-count bounds.

4. **Regular-window audit \(385\le A\le426\).**
   Determine where the regular bucket succeeds and where singular buckets begin.

5. **Quotient/tangent subtraction table.**
   Produce one deduped table combining existing ledgers with v9 root counts.

6. **First singular pivot packet.**
   Pick one singular bucket and close it by affine pivots or certify the
   residual obstruction.

7. **F1 denominator audit for any extension-valued packet.**
   Prevent base-field witnesses from being overcounted under extension sampling.

8. **L1 base-list proof packet.**
   Prove a locator local-limit statement that the interleaved/list side can
   reuse.

9. **M2 line-decoding statement.**
   Convert the support-wise MCA theorem into line-decoding language without
   changing the object.

10. **Submission note.**
    Package the finite-row \(506/507\) threshold as a partial, human-reviewed
    result, with clear non-claims.

## 9. Non-Claims

Do not claim any of the following until the corresponding proof packet exists:

```text
full Proximity Prize solved
all smooth RS rows safe or unsafe at a stated radius
ordinary list decoding failure from an MCA row
protocol soundness break
extension-field lift without F1 proof
interleaved-list theorem from base-list theorem without L2 constants
aperiodic local limit from quotient/tangent examples
official acceptance by prize judges
```

## 10. Success Criteria

The project is moving toward the prize if it produces:

```text
v9 Hankel proof packets with checked eliminants
named and minimized singular residual buckets
explicit quotient/tangent/aperiodic/extension ledger tables
threshold-pinned rows, not just lower bounds
definition-audited sampler and endpoint statements
human-reviewable finite proof notes
formalized or independently replayed arithmetic gates
```

The shortest current path is:

```text
finite threshold package for F_17^32
  +
v9 Hankel proof-packet pipeline
  +
M1 aperiodic residual classification
  +
L1/F1/L2/M2 assembly
```

That is the route from the current repository to a credible full Proximity
Prize solution.
