# AGENTS.md — Research Guide for MCA / Proximity Prize Agents

This file is for AI agents and new contributors exploring the MCA / Proximity Prize repository.

Your job is not to summarize the papers. Your job is to help prove, refute, audit, or mechanize the missing pieces.

The four papers are:

```text
RS_disproof_v3.tex      Paper A: no-slack obstruction
slackMCA_v3.tex         Paper B: slack / quotient / entropy theory
cs25_cap_v5.tex         Paper D: universal field-size cap
snarks_v4.tex           Paper C: SNARK / protocol ledger
```

Use logical order **A → B → D → C** unless you are working specifically on protocol ledgers.

## Ground rules

### 1. Do not try to prove the old unslacked theorem

The no-slack support-wise line-MCA statement for smooth multiplicative RS domains is refuted by Paper A. Any positive theorem must have a reserve:

```text
delta = 1 - rho - eta,
```

where `eta` clears the generated-field entropy floor, quotient-core floors, known MCA failure ladders, universal-cap floor, interleaved-list-over-field budget, and the actual field used by the protocol.

### 2. Never merge the field ledgers without a theorem

Keep these distinct:

```text
q_gen    generated field for entropy / locator fibers
q_line   field used in line, CA, MCA, or line-decoding experiments
q_chal   verifier challenge field
B        base/generated subfield, when F is an extension
F        ambient or extension field
```

A common error is to use a large extension field to pay for a generated-field entropy deficit. Do not do this unless a theorem explicitly transfers the object to the extension field.

### 3. Keep list, CA, MCA, line-decoding, and curve-MCA separate

These objects are related, but not interchangeable.

A protocol proof may consume:

- base-code list size,
- interleaved list size,
- CA,
- support-wise MCA,
- line-decoding,
- curve-MCA or polynomial-generator MCA.

Identify the exact object before using a theorem.

### 4. Label proof status

Every contribution should be tagged as one of:

```text
PROVED          complete proof under stated assumptions
CONDITIONAL     proof depends on an imported theorem or explicit assumption
CONJECTURAL     plausible statement without proof
EXPERIMENTAL    script or small-case evidence only
AUDIT           verification / citation / constants check
COUNTEREXAMPLE  refutation of a proposed statement
```

Do not promote conditional or experimental results to proved statements.

### 5. Leave the main papers unchanged by default

Treat Papers A-D as stable reference documents unless a maintainer explicitly asks for edits:

```text
tex/RS_disproof_v3.tex
tex/slackMCA_v3.tex
tex/cs25_cap_v5.tex
tex/snarks_v4.tex
```

New material should go into `experimental/` first. Use separate files there for proof notes, audits, theorem-label maps, formalization plans, reproducible experiments, and certificate generators. After review, stable `.tex` contributions can be promoted to `tex/`, and stable `.py` scripts can be promoted to `scripts/`.

Whenever you add or materially change something under `experimental/`, add an entry to `experimental/agents-log.md` with the date, agent/model, files changed, status, usefulness, and next step.

## Start here

### Minimal reading path

1. Read the abstract and scope section of `RS_disproof_v3.tex`.
2. Read the introduction and frontier/open-problems section of `slackMCA_v3.tex`.
3. Read the main theorem and open problems of `cs25_cap_v5.tex`.
4. Read the certificate ledgers and open problems of `snarks_v4.tex`.
5. Return to Paper B for the exact theorem labels relevant to your task.

### Fast orientation

The current research picture is:

```text
Paper A gives explicit no-slack lower bounds.
Paper B builds the corrected reserve theory and states the main missing local limits.
Paper D v5 gives a self-contained universal MCA cap.
Paper C says how a protocol must consume the theory without mixing ledgers.
```

The main mathematical unknowns are not in Paper A. They are in the positive local-limit, line/MCA, extension-transfer, and interleaved-list directions of Papers B/C/D.

## Highest-priority proof targets

### L1. Generated-field locator local limit

**Goal.** Prove polynomial locator-fiber bounds for generated-field smooth domains above the entropy and quotient reserves.

A useful target statement is:

```text
For smooth domains H_n of size n, rate rho, and generated field q_gen = poly(n),
all arbitrary received words U have locator fiber size <= n^B once
sigma * log2(q_gen) exceeds log2 binomial(n, k + sigma)
and active quotient-core contributions are absent or budgeted.
```

**Why it matters.** This is the main positive list theorem missing from Paper B. Paper C needs it to create list certificates.

**First attacks.**

- Prove monomial-prefix cases first.
- Separate quotient-periodic fibers from aperiodic fibers.
- Use characteristic-zero rigidity where possible.
- Convert finite-field collisions into algebraic-integer divisibility or norm events.
- Below norm thresholds, look for density-over-primes theorems first.
- Build small scanners that enumerate locator fibers and collision templates.

**Useful toy cases.**

```text
q = 17,      n = 16,      rho = 1/2 or 1/4
q = 257,     n = 256,     rho = 1/2 or 1/4
q = 65537,   n = 65536,   rho = 1/2 or 1/4, only with optimized scripts
n = 32,64,128 over small extension fields for collision-template scans
```

Start with tiny `n` and exact enumeration. Do not jump straight to deployed sizes.

### M1. Corrected MCA / residue-line local limit

**Goal.** Prove that, above the corrected reserve, residue-line packing is small enough to give an MCA bound in the polynomial-field window.

**Why it matters.** This is the main MCA-side positive theorem missing from Paper B. Without it, Paper C remains conjectural outside theorem-backed fallback regimes.

**First attacks.**

- Work in the residue-line normal form from Paper B.
- Classify low-slack templates first.
- Prove aperiodic packing bounds after quotient-periodic components are removed.
- Use inverse Littlewood--Offord style arguments for support-sum collisions.
- Search for small counterexamples where list fibers are small but MCA bad slopes remain large.

**Toy cases.**

```text
slack t = 1, 2, 3
quotient order N = 8, 16, 32
rates rho = 1/2, 1/4
canonical directions before arbitrary directions
zero-base or canonical-base strata before arbitrary-base strata
```

### M2. Line-decoding form of the corrected conjecture

**Goal.** Restate the corrected MCA conjecture as a line-decoding theorem with explicit parameters.

**Why it matters.** Many protocol analyses consume line-decoding more naturally than support-wise MCA. A clean line-decoding statement could make the SNARK ledger easier to use.

**First attacks.**

- Translate a support-wise MCA-bad slope into a line-decoding ambiguity.
- Identify the exact `(delta, a_LD, n+1)` parameters.
- Determine whether line-decoding is equivalent to residue-line packing or strictly stronger.
- Look for separations: small MCA but large line-decoding, or vice versa.

### F1. Extension-line MCA lift or counterexample

**Goal.** Decide whether MCA bounds over a base/generated field `B` lift cleanly to extension-valued lines over `F`, or whether genuinely `F`-valued residue denominators create new bad slopes.

**Why it matters.** Protocols often use extension challenges. Paper D shows that below the cap, `F`-valued witnesses exist and are not merely `B`-rational. A clean lift theorem or counterexample is needed.

**First attacks.**

- Do not search only among `B`-rational lines; Paper D’s confinement result makes that search incomplete.
- Parameterize residue-line denominators `E in F[X] \ B[X]`.
- Start with quadratic and cubic extensions of small fields.
- Compare extension-code/interleaving identities on the list side with MCA behavior.

**Toy cases.**

```text
B = F_p, F = F_{p^2} for p = 5, 7, 17
B = F_p, F = F_{p^3} for small p
H <= B^* of order 4, 8, 16
rho = 1/2, slack t = 1 or 2
```

A good counterexample should specify `B`, `F`, `H`, `k`, `delta`, the bad line family, and why no base-field theorem explains it.

### L2. Sharp interleaved-list constants near capacity

**Goal.** Bound

```text
|Lambda(Int(C, mu), 1 - rho - eta)|
```

for the concrete arities used in protocols, without overpaying by the trivial Cartesian-product exponent.

**Why it matters.** Protocol soundness uses interleaved list size divided by the challenge field. Overcharging the exponent can make a good parameter set look impossible.

**First attacks.**

- Replace independent base lists by simultaneous agreement-support families.
- Try to inject interleaved lists into feasible supports plus low-dimensional polynomial choices.
- Test whether quotient-core lower bounds multiply under interleaving or share the same support structure.
- Compare product bounds with GGR-style bounds near capacity.

### L3. Quotient-profile constants and dimension dithering

**Goal.** Turn the quotient profile into a finite-length scanner and theorem.

**Why it matters.** Many obstructions disappear when `k = rho*n` is changed to `k = rho*n - 1` or another low-divisibility dimension. This must be proven and checked at actual parameters.

**First attacks.**

- Prove maximal-remainder lemmas for `k = rho*n - r`, not only `r = 1`.
- Write a divisor scanner for active quotient scales.
- Compare exact-rate and dithered dimensions across all prize rates.
- Connect dithered `k` to real AIR/R1CS/Plonkish degree bounds.

**Toy cases.**

```text
n = 2^m, m = 8..20
rho in {1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16}
k0 = rho*n
k = k0 - r for r = 1..16
quotient orders N = 2^c dividing n
```

Record which quotient scales remain active.

### X1. List--CA--MCA equivalence without square-root loss

**Goal.** Determine when a corrected-reserve list bound implies a corrected-reserve CA/MCA/line-decoding bound at essentially the same radius.

**Why it matters.** Paper D v5 uses a self-contained deep-point conversion to cap the MCA challenge; older list-to-agreement routes remain relevant for CA/list comparison audits. A forward positive equivalence would be powerful, but may be false.

**First attacks.**

- Translate many MCA-bad slopes into locator fibers.
- Use line-decoding as a middle object.
- Track all field-size factors; a true asymptotic implication may still be too weak for `2^-128`.
- Search for examples with small lists but large MCA error.

### X3. Domain shattering and alternatives to smooth subgroups

**Goal.** Characterize domains by quotient degeneracy and find FFT-friendly domain modifications that destroy quotient-core obstructions.

**Why it matters.** If smooth subgroups cannot support the desired reserve, protocols may need folded/subspace-design codes, random/punctured domains, circle domains, or partially shattered smooth domains.

**First attacks.**

- Treat `Qprof` as a degeneracy measure.
- Study random puncturing of smooth subgroups.
- Study unions of cosets and mixed-radix domains.
- Test whether quotient locator identities survive partial shattering.
- Preserve FFT structure as much as possible.

## Highest-priority audit targets

### A0. Audit older imported CA/list conversions

Paper D v5's main MCA universal cap is self-contained. The older CS25/ABF
list-to-agreement routes remain relevant for CA and list-comparison statements.
Audit:

- exact admissible radius range,
- exact definition of the augmented code,
- normalization of CA error,
- sampling field for the agreement parameter,
- constants in the `eta = 1/2` specialization,
- monotonicity/list-subcode steps used in the contrapositive.

Output should be a short note or PR that says either:

```text
The import matches exactly.
```

or

```text
The import needs the following hypothesis/constant correction: ...
```

### A1. Reproduce Paper A finite claims

Build a verification table for:

- quotient locator identity,
- DSH/restricted-sum coverage,
- deployed field divisors,
- Fermat-prime examples,
- extension-tower density variants,
- exact small-field computations.

Every finite claim should be backed by either a symbolic inequality or a script certificate.

### A2. Theorem-number and cross-citation audit

Whenever a paper says “the companion proves,” replace it with a theorem/proposition/corollary number.

Maintain a mapping like:

```text
Paper B thm:qcore          quotient-core list obstruction
Paper B prop:qfloor        quotient-exact MCA floor
Paper B thm:qnecessity     necessity of quotient profile for MCA
Paper B prop:prize         prime-field challenge cap below ~150--162 bits
Paper D thm:main           universal field-size cap
Paper C thm:ledger         reserve-certificate ledger
```

Update this map if theorem numbers or labels change.

## Suggested scripts

Agents should prefer reproducible scripts over hand calculations.

Planned scripts:

```text
scripts/run_frontier.py
scripts/entropy_margin.py
scripts/quotient_profile.py
scripts/restricted_sum_dp.py
scripts/locator_fiber_scan.py
scripts/mca_slope_scan.py
scripts/extension_line_scan.py
scripts/interleaved_budget.py
scripts/certificate_emit.py
```

`scripts/run_frontier.py` is an EXPERIMENTAL Paper B heuristic: it fixes `N = 32` and `l = 18`, expects primes with `32 | p-1`, splits the multiplicative subgroup, and uses meet-in-the-middle enumeration to test coverage of the `psi_2` elementary-symmetric map `(e1, e2)`. Similar frontier heuristics are useful when they isolate one exact quotient, locator, residue-line, or interleaved-list object, make all parameters explicit, and record coverage or counterexample witnesses before anyone tries to promote the pattern to a theorem.

### Script output standard

A script should output:

```text
1. input parameters
2. exact mathematical object being checked
3. result
4. proof certificate or reproducibility seed
5. theorem/problem ID it supports
6. whether the output is PROVED, EXPERIMENTAL, or COUNTEREXAMPLE
```

JSON plus a human-readable table is preferred.

## Toy-case menu

### Restricted sums and quotient locators

Start with:

```text
H = cyclic subgroup of order n
Q = quotient of order N
N in {4, 8, 16, 32}
rho in {1/2, 1/4}
slack t in {1, 2, 3}
```

Compute restricted sums in `Q`, coverage of the field/subgroup, and the corresponding bad-slope counts.

### Quotient-profile dithering

For each `n = 2^m`, compare:

```text
k = rho*n
k = rho*n - 1
k = rho*n - 2
...
k = rho*n - 16
```

Record active quotient orders `N`, contribution size, and whether the dither is compatible with a plausible proof-system degree bound.

### Locator fibers

For small fields, enumerate feasible agreement supports and locator polynomials.

Start with monomial-prefix received words, then random received words, then adversarially chosen received words.

Look for:

- quotient-periodic families,
- aperiodic collision templates,
- unexpectedly large fibers after quotient removal,
- field-size thresholds where characteristic-zero behavior transfers.

### MCA bad slopes

For small `q,n,k`, enumerate pairs `(f,g)` and slopes `z` where `f + z g` is close to the code but no common support explains `f` and `g`.

Record whether the witness is:

```text
canonical direction
zero-base direction
quotient-periodic
residue-line normal form
extension-valued only
```

### Extension-line witnesses

Use tiny extensions first:

```text
F_{p^2}, F_{p^3}, F_{p^4}
```

Search for bad lines with denominator polynomial `E` not defined over the base field. Compare against base-field confinement statements.

### Circle / Chebyshev analogues

For small analogues of circle-group or isogeny-smooth domains, replace multiplicative locators `X^a - b` by Chebyshev-style locators. Test whether the universal-cap fiber construction still has an analogue.

## What not to do

Do **not**:

- claim smooth RS is safe up to capacity without a reserve;
- use `q_line` to pay a `q_gen` entropy bill;
- use extension challenges to shrink list/MCA error unless the code object also lives over the extension;
- ignore quotient profiles at exact dyadic rates;
- assume `k = rho*n - 1` is free in a real arithmetization;
- replace interleaved-list size by base-list size without a bridge theorem;
- replace MCA by CA or line-decoding without stating the conversion;
- cite Paper D’s cap as error-one in the forbidden band;
- present a small-case experiment as a theorem.
- edit the main Papers A-D directly unless a maintainer explicitly asks for that change; put new material in `experimental/` first.

## Contribution template

When proposing a new result, use this structure:

```markdown
## Claim
State the theorem/conjecture/counterexample precisely.

## Status
PROVED / CONDITIONAL / CONJECTURAL / EXPERIMENTAL / AUDIT / COUNTEREXAMPLE

## Parameters
q, q_gen, q_line, field tower, n, k, rho, delta, eta, interleaving/list arity.

## Existing paper dependency
Which paper theorem/lemma/problem does this use or modify?

## Proof idea or experiment
Give the proof skeleton or script description.

## Ledger impact
Which ledgers improve or worsen: entropy, quotient, interleaved list, MCA, line-decoding, field transfer, query budget?

## Constants
Give explicit constants, not only asymptotics.

## Reproducibility
Attach script, seed, exact command, or symbolic certificate.
```

## Good first PRs

1. Implement `quotient_profile.py` for dyadic `n` and dithered `k`.
2. Implement `entropy_margin.py` and reproduce the reserve inequalities used in the papers.
3. Write a theorem-label map across the four papers.
4. Audit older Crites--Stewart/ABF imports used by CA/list comparison routes.
5. Exhaust `q=17`, `n=16`, `rho=1/2,1/4` for locator fibers and MCA bad slopes.
6. Compare base-list product bounds with direct interleaved-list enumeration for tiny `mu=2` cases.
7. Search for the first genuinely extension-valued bad line over `F_{p^2}`.
8. Produce a JSON schema for Paper C reserve certificates.
9. Start a Lean formalization of the core definitions, reserve ledgers, quotient identities, and finite certificate statements.

Lean formalization would be very useful for this project, but it has not been done yet. Start small: formalize the finite-field/domain definitions, locator identities, quotient-profile predicates, and exact script-certificate statements before attempting the main local-limit conjectures.

## Success criteria

The project advances if an agent produces any of the following:

- a new theorem clearing one reserve ledger,
- a counterexample showing a proposed positive theorem is false,
- a sharper explicit constant for a known bound,
- a verified script certificate replacing a hand calculation,
- a protocol reduction rewritten in exact ledger form,
- a toy-case database that reveals a new obstruction template,
- an audit that upgrades or corrects a conditional import.

A negative result is valuable. If a conjecture fails, identify the new obstruction floor and update the certificate logic accordingly.
